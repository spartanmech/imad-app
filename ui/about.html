                    J.A.R.V.I.S. (Stands for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System), also stylized as JARVIS, or Jarvis, is a highly advanced computerized A.I. developed by Tony Stark, and was voiced by actor Paul Bettany, to manage almost everything, especially matters related to technology, in Tony's life.
                    <p>
                    He was based on Edwin Jarvis, who was the Stark family's butler. He acts like Tony's best friend when it comes to his personal life and other secret matters, that are enclosed only with Tony and him.

                    <p>
                    J.A.R.V.I.S. appears as a core membrane, where all his data and his operating systems works. He uses all the technology around him, provided that he is connected with it. He often appears on holograms, computers and also in Tony's Iron Man suits.
